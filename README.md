# 🚀 Cabin Booking Web App 🏕️

Here is a project that I have revisited. This is a cabin booking web app that I originally co-designed and co-coded at the end of my front-end development training. This year, I took the time to enhance and completely re-code it in Vue.js, making it responsive and accessible.

## 🌟 Features

- **User Registration and Account Management**
- **Filter Cabins by Region, Date Range, and Number of Travelers**
- **Select Favorite Cabins**
- **Scroll Through Photos and Get Additional Details on Each Cabin**
- **Write Comments and Make Reservations Once Logged In**
- **Store Favorites and Reservations on the User Account Page**
- **Interact with Forms that Display Error Messages for Empty or Incorrect Fields**

## 👨‍💻 Technologies

- **Vue.js** (vue-router, vue-date-picker, userstore, composables, modular components)
- **Tailwind CSS** (tailwind config, reusable styles)
- **Elixir for the Backend** (special thanks to Christophe Belpaire for his valuable assistance!)

## 📈 Possible Improvements

Since this is a fictional school project, several improvements could still be considered, such as:

- **Integration of a Secure Payment System**
- **Performance and SEO Optimization**
- **Addition of New Advanced Search Features**
- **Enhancement of the User Interface for a Better User Experience**
